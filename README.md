### Abstract:
This project explores predicting box office success using a Bayesian approach with movie metadata. 
By integrating Bayesian Networks, Hierarchical Bayesian Regression, Hidden Markov Models, and MCMC sampling, we develop a robust probabilistic framework for revenue forecasting.
Our methodology provides credible intervals for revenue estimates, assisting investors and studios in optimizing financial decision-making.
